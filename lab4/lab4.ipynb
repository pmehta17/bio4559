The easiest way to do this is with the relative file path; where the file exists relative to the script you are running. Some examples: (1) For a file that exists in the same folder as your script, the filepath is simply `\"data_to_read.csv\"`, (2) for a file in the directory above, the filepath is `\"../data_to_read.csv\"`, and (3) for a file in a sub-directory of the directory that you're currently in (say it's `data`), the filepath is `\"data/data_to_read.csv.\"` We can combine (2) and (3); for example `\"../data/flight_data/data_to_read.csv\"` describes navigating up one directory, then going in the `data` directory, then the `flight_data` subfolder where the data is located.\n",
